Exercise: Cruise Ships

Over the next couple of weeks, we are going to cover further aspects of Object-oriented Programming - namely how we pass objects into one another and test for this, how we decide what methods and properties our objects should have, how we isolate objects in tests, and how we test behaviour that's outside of our control.

translate these user stories into objects, methods and properties. We call this domain modelling.
